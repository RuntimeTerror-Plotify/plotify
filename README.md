## Introduction

**Plotify**, as the name suggests, will let you to play with your data. It is a web app that helps to analyze data and perform different statistical methods without having to write code. It is deliberately developed for machine learning and data science nerds. You can upload your data, play with it using some of the methods, and thereafter download the results. Yes, you heard that right; it is that simple, and there is no need to worry about typing code and fixing it. And don't worry if you're a beginner who's not confident what to do with data and whatnot; we've got you covered with step-by-step tutorials, and you can even try your hands on data while learning.

## Purpose

_*Want to train your machine learning model quickly but are constrained by data preprocessing ?
Do you find data preprocessing and visualizing time-consuming?*_

To provide a solution, we have created a website where you can perform all of the steps of data preprocessing and data analysis without writing code. Using this app will also save you time as you do not have to worry about writing code or plotting graphs. Even if you get stuck and don't know what to do next, we provide you tutorials, recommendations, and some tips.

## Features

- **_Analyze Data_** - A descriptive statistics tab displays all the basic information about your data where, Numerical and Categorical data columns are analyzed separately.

- **_Visualise Data_** - Visualize a particular feature using Univariate plots( Histogram, Box Plot, Scatter Plot, Line Plot) and Multivariate plots(Correlation Matrix)
