    <h2>Data Cleaning: Drop Columns</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The first thing in Data cleaning is handling NAN/null values. To do this there are various
        stratergies. The first one we will see is dropping columns.</p>
        
        <h5><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> &nbsp;There are various reasons behind dropping a column:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Column with high NAN values</li>
            <li>Column with high correlation with others</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>Let's understand the reason behind them:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h6>Column with high NAN values: </h6> 
                We can handle NAN values in two ways either drop them or fill them. Here we will
                talk only about dropping columns due to high percentage of NAN values. NAN values
                and may make the data biased. Moreover, few models does not support NAN values. 
                Thus we need to properly take care of NAN values. If a column has NAN values more 
                that <em>50%</em>, it is suggested that you drop the column as it would be no use 
                for the model or analysis.  
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Column with high correlation: </b>
                If two columns have high correlation then it is expected that data they report are 
                highly matching and they depict almost same information to model and analysis. If a
                column has high correlation say above 0.9 or below -0.9. Then it is suggested that
                you drop the column as both the columns would depict same things. <br>
                <b>*Ps:</b> <em>It is suggested 
                to think twice before dropping a column as two different columns might high correlation
                but both columns are equally important according to the use case. </em>
