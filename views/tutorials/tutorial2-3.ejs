    <h4>Labelling Categorical Data</h4>

    <h3>One-Hot-Encoding</h3>

    <p>
        Though label encoding is straight but it has the disadvantage that the numeric values can be misinterpreted by
        algorithms as having some sort of hierarchy/order in them. This ordering issue is addressed in another common
        alternative approach called ‘One-Hot Encoding’. In this strategy, each category value is converted into a new
        column and assigned a 1 or 0 (notation for true/false) value to the column.
        <br>
        Example For Such Conversions:

        <p>Generally this type of Labelling should be used with Ordinal Data</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Advantages:</li>
            <p>It Effectively converts columns with hierarchical categories without losing the impact of different gaps
                betweeen them.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Disadvantages</li>
            <p>Converting a column with large number of categories lead to high memory consuption</p>
        </ul>
