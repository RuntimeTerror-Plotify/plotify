    <h2>Skewness</h2>
        
            <p>
            Data Skewness is asymmetry in a statistical distribution, in which the curve appears distorted or skewed
            either to the left or to the right. Skewness can be quantified to define the extent to which a distribution
            differs from a normal distribution.
            </p>

            <h5><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> &nbsp;Normal Distribution:</h5>
            <p>In a normal distribution, the graph appears as a classical, symmetrical “bell-shaped curve.” The mean, or
            average, and the mode, or maximum point on the curve, are equal.</p>

            <br>

            <h5><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> &nbsp;Types Of Skewness:</h5>
            <p>In a symmetric bell curve, the mean, median, and mode are all the same value. But in a skewed distribution,
            the mean, median, and mode are all different values.</p>
            <p>A skewed data distribution or bell curve can be either positive or negative.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A positively skewed distribution means that the extreme data results are larger. This skews the data in that
                    it brings the mean (average) up. The mean will be larger than the median in a Positively skewed
                    distribution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A negatively skewed distribution means the opposite: that the extreme data results are smaller. This means
                    that the mean is brought down, and the median is larger than the mean in a negatively skewed distribution.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            

            <h6>NOTE : </h6><em>Skewness value lies above +1 or below -1, data is highly skewed. If it lies between +0.5 to -0.5,
                it is moderately skewed. If the value is 0, then the data is symmetric.</em> 


            <h3>Reducing skewness</h3>
            <p>A data transformation may be used to reduce skewness. A distribution that is symmetric or nearly so is
            often easier to handle and interpret than a skewed distribution. More specifically, a normal or Gaussian
            distribution is often regarded as ideal as it is assumed by many statistical methods.</p>

            <h4><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> &nbsp;Reducing Right Skewness</h4>

            <h5>Right skewness can be reduced applying following transformation</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><h6>Square root</h6>
                    <p>The square root, x to x^(1/2) = sqrt(x), is a transformation with a
                        moderate effect on distribution shape: it is weaker than the logarithm
                        and the cube root. It is also used for reducing right skewness, and also
                        has the advantage that it can be applied to zero values. Note that the
                        square root of an area has the units of a length. It is commonly applied
                        to counted data, especially if the values are mostly rather small.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><h6>Cube root</h6>
                    <p>The cube root, x to x^(1/3). This is a fairly strong transformation with
                    a substantial effect on distribution shape: it is weaker than the
                    logarithm. It is also used for reducing right skewness, and has the
                    advantage that it can be applied to zero and negative values. Note that
                    the cube root of a volume has the units of a length. It is commonly
                    applied to rainfall data.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h6>Logarithms:</h6>
                    <p>
                        The logarithm, x to log base 10 of x, or x to log base e of x (ln x), or x to log base 2 of x, is a strong
                        transformation with a major effect on distribution shape. It is commonly used for reducing right skewness
                        and is often appropriate for measured variables. It can not be applied to zero or negative values.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><h5>Reciprocals:</h5>
                    <p>The reciprocal, x to 1/x, with its sibling the negative reciprocal, x to -1/x, is a very strong
                        transformation with a drastic effect on distribution shape. It can not be applied to zero values. Although
                        it can be applied to negative values, it is not useful unless all values are positive.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> &nbsp;Reducing Left Skewness</h4>
            <h5>Left skewness can be reduced applying the following transformation</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><h5>Squares:</h5>
                    <p>The square, x to x², has a moderate effect on distribution shape and it could be used to reduce left
                        skewness. Squaring usually makes sense only if the variable concerned is zero or positive, given that (-x)²
                        and x² are identical.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h6>Cubes:</h6>
                    <p>The cube, x to x³, has a better effect on distribution shape than squaring and it could be used to reduce
                        left skewness.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h6>Higher powers:</h6>
                    <p>When simple transformation like square and cubes doesn’t reduce the skewness in the data distribution, we
                        can use Higher powers to transform to data. It is only useful in left skewness.</p>
                </li>
