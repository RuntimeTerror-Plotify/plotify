    <h4>Principal Component Analysis</h4>



    <div>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Large datasets are increasingly widespread in many disciplines. In order to interpret such datasets, methods
            are required to drastically reduce their dimensionality in an interpretable way, such that most of the
            information in the data is preserved. Many techniques have been developed for this purpose, but principal
            component analysis (PCA) is one of the oldest and most widely used. Its idea is simple—reduce the
            dimensionality of a dataset, while preserving as much ‘variability’ (i.e. statistical information) as
            possible.

        <h3>What Does PCA do ?</h3>
        PCA finds a new set of dimensions (or a set of basis of views) such that all the dimensions are orthogonal
        (and hence linearly independent) and ranked according to the variance of data along them. It means more
        important principle axis occurs first. (more important = more variance/more spread out data) .
        <br>
        Always normalize your data before doing PCA because if we use data(features here) of different scales, we
        get misleading components. We can also simply use correlation matrix instead of using covariance matrix if
        features are of different scales.
        <br>

        <h3>This defines the goal of PCA -</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Find linearly independent dimensions (or basis of views) which can losslessly represent the data points.
            </li>
            <li>Those newly found dimensions should allow us to predict/reconstruct the original dimensions. The
                reconstruction/projection error should be minimized.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Output</h3>
        Plotify would give you the output in form of newly built same number of columns. Alongside you would be provided
        with which column consisit of how much percentage of data, hence that would help you to delete the required
        columns.
